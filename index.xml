      <description>This project was part of an initiation to Kaggle datasets and competitions. The problem statement is to predict the housing prices from suburbs/towns in USA. The data is available in Kaggle itself. Techniques of data preprocessing is required and then to predict the house prices.
I have used multiple techniques such as XGBoost, Linear regression, Random Forest to determine the best fit for the project. Used choropleth also to determine the density of the US population.</description>

      <description>Used pandas datareader option to import Netflix stock data over the last ten years. Yahoo Api was used to obtain the dataset. The objective of the project was to understand how models such as LSTM/ ARIMAX/ Auto ARIMA works and thus to predict the stock prices for next 2 months and then compare with the actual prices in future. Libraries used Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, ARIMAX. Keras, Dense, Sequential models were used to predict the future prices Key metrics such as ADF, P-value was implemeted to test normality of data Data preprocessing was done using MinMaxScaler and then the data set was split into training and testing datasets LSTM was implemented and a comparison between actual prices and predicted prices was done.</description>

      <description>WORK DONE: Factor analysis is to understand the influences of latent variables(unobserved), you cant directly measure. These latent variables are believed to be driving observed variables. Two types of FA: Exploratory and Confirmatory Exploratory: there is no precise relationship b/w observed and latent variables Confirmatory: it is established^ Two ways to fit the model: Bayesian or by frequency based
TECHNIQUES APPLIED: Exploratory factor analysis is done using frequencies method Libraries used: factor_analyser, math, scikit_learn etc.</description>
